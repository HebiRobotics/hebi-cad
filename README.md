# hebi-cad (cad.hebi.us)
HEBI Robotics CAD files, drawings, and meshes

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The CAD files in this Repository are stored using **Git LFS**. It is suggested to download files individually from the web as opposed to cloning the entire repo. If you choose to clone the entire repository, ensure you have Git LFS installed and initialized or the files will not properly checkout.

## Organization
Each item has a folder with its part number and description.  In each folder you will find the 3D information for the part in the following file formats:

### Formats that preview natively in Github
* PDF Drawing (if applicable)
* PNG Image
* STL

### Other formats
* STEP
* OBJ + MTL
* 3MF?

## Please Bear With Us
_This is a work-in-progress as we migrate our public CAD files over from GrabCAD (R.I.P.)_
