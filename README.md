# hebi-cad (cad.hebi.us)
Public Repository for HEBI Robotics CAD files, drawings, and meshes.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The CAD files in this Repository are stored using **Git LFS**. It is suggested to download files individually from the web as opposed to cloning the entire repo. If you choose to clone the entire repository, ensure you have Git LFS installed and initialized or the files will not properly checkout.

## Organization
Each item has a folder with its part number and description.  If you're on a narrow screen or window and don't see the files to the left in a sidebar, you can go to the files directly at:
https://github.com/HebiRobotics/hebi-cad/

In each folder you will find the 3D information for the part in the following file formats:

### Formats that preview natively in Github
* PDF Drawing (if applicable)
* PNG or JPEG Image
* STL

### Other formats
* SLDPRT (SolidWorks 2022/2024, new files will be SW2024)
* STEP
* OBJ + MTL

## Let us know if something's missing
_This repo is migration of our public CAD files from GrabCAD (R.I.P.)_

> [!NOTE] 
> If you find a part where one of the file formats above is missing, or there's a HEBI component that you would like CAD files for that is not already found here please contact [support@hebirobotics.com](mailto:support@hebirobotics.com?subject=HEBI%20CAD%20Request)
